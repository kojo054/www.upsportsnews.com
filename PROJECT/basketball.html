            <p>Plymouth City Patriots will not take part in the new season of Super League Basketball.

Plymouth have had a team playing at the top level of British basketball since 2004.

But the club, who finished bottom of the table last season, announced they could not continue for the upcoming campaign.

"It is with regret that Plymouth City Patriots will not be part of the league for the 2024-25 season," the club said in a statement., external

"Keeping a professional team in Plymouth, for everyone in Devon and Cornwall, has been the main focus of everyone involved with the club and it is with great sadness that we are not able to operate in the new season."

The Patriots were building towards their fourth season, having replaced the Plymouth Raiders in 2021 as the city's top-level club.

The first season of Super League Basketball, which has replaced the British Basketball League, will now only feature nine teams.

The statement added: "There is always hope that there will be a Plymouth-based team playing in the top league of the sport in the future and we wish the nine teams involved with Super League Basketball the best of luck in the coming season."</p>

        A star-studded United States side showed their quality when it mattered as they fought back from a 13-point deficit in the final quarter to beat Serbia in a thrilling Olympic men's basketball semi-final.

The vast array of NBA superstars, led by LeBron James and Steph Curry, trailed 76-63 after three quarters.

But they turned up the heat and turned around the deficit to win 95-91 at a noisy Bercy Arena.

"To come back the way we did... I've seen a lot of team USA basketball and that was a special," said Curry, who finished with game-high 36 points.

The comeback maintained the Americans' bid for a fifth successive gold in an Olympic event which they have dominated since it was introduced in 1936.

On Saturday, they will play hosts France in the gold-medal match.

Serbia, led by Nikola Jokic, the NBA's reigning most valuable player (MVP), must settle for a crack at bronze when they face Germany earlier on the same day.

The Gen Z Dream Team prove their worth
Pretty much every US Olympic squad since the 1992 Games has been compared to the 'Dream Team' led by Michael Jordan and none have ever come close.

This Gen Z ensemble cast, featuring four NBA regular season MVP winners - James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid - 11 NBA All-Stars and seven NBA champions, is not far behind.

Coach Steve Kerr - himself one of the greatest bosses in NBA history - wondered how he would knit together five players from a 12-man squad where each could be a future Hall of Famer.

Against Serbia it took a while for the individuals to get going as a team with only Curry, finding space to land his trademark three-pointers, keeping them within touching distance.

Jokic looked on course to upstage his American opponents, playing a key role as Serbia, who led by as many as 17 points, stifled them in a dominant first half.

But, as the US powered back into the game, Serbia faltered.

Three-pointers from Durant and Embiid started to turn the tide in the last quarter before James bustled through to put them level at 84-84.

Curry landed another from behind the arc as the Americans led with two minutes and 24 seconds left - the first time they had been ahead since 45 seconds after the game started.

With an A-List crowd including rapper Travis Scott cheering them on, they closed out a memorable victory and danced in celebration on the court.

Serbia were unhappy with some of the refereeing decisions in the clutch moments, making their feelings known by lambasting the officials as they walked off the floor.
