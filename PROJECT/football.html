            <p>Bournemouth have signed Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga on a season-long loan deal.

Kepa, 29, is the world's most expensive goalkeeper after moving to the Blues in 2018 from his boyhood club Athletic Bilbao for £71m.

This week the Spain international extended his contract at Chelsea, which had been due to expire at the end of the 2025 season, by a year.

"I know Andoni Iraola well, so of course that was a big reason for coming here, he spoke very well about everything here," Kepa, who played with Bournemouth boss Iraola at Bilbao, told the club's YouTube channel, external.

"I am so ready to be here and play in front of our fans.

"Hopefully we can win something and it could be a great year."

He spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, where he made 20 appearances as a replacement for the injured Thibaut Courtois, winning La Liga and the Champions League.

By signing a new deal at Chelsea, the Blues avoid the prospect of losing Kepa on a free transfer at the end of his loan spell with the Cherries.

"We are delighted to bring a player of Kepa's calibre to AFC Bournemouth," said Cherries chief executive Neill Blake.

"We were aware of his availability and were keen to take the opportunity to bring him to the club on loan.

"We believe he will be an exciting addition to our talented goalkeeping department."

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti had been interested in re-signing the Spaniard but it was dependent on Andriy Lunin leaving the club.

That left Kepa training, along with 14 other players, away from manager Enzo Maresca's first-team squad.

Kepa also rejected a permanent move to Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad in July.

Also on Thursday the Cherries announced winger Jaidon Anthony had joined Burnley on a season-long loan.

The 24-year-old was a key player for Clarets manager Scott Parker when he took the Cherries into the Premier League in the 2021-22 season, and links up again with his former boss at Turf Moor..</p>

         La Liga champions Real Madrid were held to a frustrating draw by Las Palmas.

The Canary Islands hosts took an early lead when Scotland striker Oli McBurnie picked out youngster Alberto Moleiro, who skipped into the box before firing a low shot into the bottom corner.

But Madrid levelled when Vinicius Jr scored a penalty after Alex Suarez was penalised for handball.

It extends their club-record unbeaten run to 35 games in La Liga.

Madrid, who were far from their best, had chances to win with Endrick and Kylian Mbappe going close.

Mbappe has yet to score in his three La Liga games since moving from Paris St-Germain.

Las Palmas had a late goal ruled out for a Jaime Mata offside.

       <p>Liverpool have signed Juventus winger Federico Chiesa for £10m, with a further £2.5m in add-ons based primarily on team performance.

Chiesa, 26, joins on a four-year deal and is Arne Slot's first signing to arrive at the club.

The forward was a star of the Italy squad that beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.

"I'm so happy to be a Liverpool player. When Richard Hughes called me and he said, 'do you want to join Liverpool?' – and the coach called me – I said yes immediately because I know the history of this club, I know what it represents to the fans," Chiesa told the club website.

"So, I'm so happy and I can't wait to get started."</p>  </div>
