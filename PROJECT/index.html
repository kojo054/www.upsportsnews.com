            <p>Bournemouth have signed Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga on a season-long loan deal.

Kepa, 29, is the world's most expensive goalkeeper after moving to the Blues in 2018 from his boyhood club Athletic Bilbao for £71m.

This week the Spain international extended his contract at Chelsea, which had been due to expire at the end of the 2025 season, by a year.

"I know Andoni Iraola well, so of course that was a big reason for coming here, he spoke very well about everything here," Kepa, who played with Bournemouth boss Iraola at Bilbao, told the club's YouTube channel, external.

"I am so ready to be here and play in front of our fans.

"Hopefully we can win something and it could be a great year."

He spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, where he made 20 appearances as a replacement for the injured Thibaut Courtois, winning La Liga and the Champions League.

By signing a new deal at Chelsea, the Blues avoid the prospect of losing Kepa on a free transfer at the end of his loan spell with the Cherries.

"We are delighted to bring a player of Kepa's calibre to AFC Bournemouth," said Cherries chief executive Neill Blake.

"We were aware of his availability and were keen to take the opportunity to bring him to the club on loan.

"We believe he will be an exciting addition to our talented goalkeeping department."

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti had been interested in re-signing the Spaniard but it was dependent on Andriy Lunin leaving the club.

That left Kepa training, along with 14 other players, away from manager Enzo Maresca's first-team squad.

Kepa also rejected a permanent move to Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad in July.

Also on Thursday the Cherries announced winger Jaidon Anthony had joined Burnley on a season-long loan.

The 24-year-old was a key player for Clarets manager Scott Parker when he took the Cherries into the Premier League in the 2021-22 season, and links up again with his former boss at Turf Moor..</p>

         La Liga champions Real Madrid were held to a frustrating draw by Las Palmas.

The Canary Islands hosts took an early lead when Scotland striker Oli McBurnie picked out youngster Alberto Moleiro, who skipped into the box before firing a low shot into the bottom corner.

But Madrid levelled when Vinicius Jr scored a penalty after Alex Suarez was penalised for handball.

It extends their club-record unbeaten run to 35 games in La Liga.

Madrid, who were far from their best, had chances to win with Endrick and Kylian Mbappe going close.

Mbappe has yet to score in his three La Liga games since moving from Paris St-Germain.

Las Palmas had a late goal ruled out for a Jaime Mata offside.

       <p>Liverpool have signed Juventus winger Federico Chiesa for £10m, with a further £2.5m in add-ons based primarily on team performance.

Chiesa, 26, joins on a four-year deal and is Arne Slot's first signing to arrive at the club.

The forward was a star of the Italy squad that beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.

"I'm so happy to be a Liverpool player. When Richard Hughes called me and he said, 'do you want to join Liverpool?' – and the coach called me – I said yes immediately because I know the history of this club, I know what it represents to the fans," Chiesa told the club website.

"So, I'm so happy and I can't wait to get started."</p>

            <p>Plymouth City Patriots will not take part in the new season of Super League Basketball.

Plymouth have had a team playing at the top level of British basketball since 2004.

But the club, who finished bottom of the table last season, announced they could not continue for the upcoming campaign.

"It is with regret that Plymouth City Patriots will not be part of the league for the 2024-25 season," the club said in a statement., external

"Keeping a professional team in Plymouth, for everyone in Devon and Cornwall, has been the main focus of everyone involved with the club and it is with great sadness that we are not able to operate in the new season."

The Patriots were building towards their fourth season, having replaced the Plymouth Raiders in 2021 as the city's top-level club.

The first season of Super League Basketball, which has replaced the British Basketball League, will now only feature nine teams.

The statement added: "There is always hope that there will be a Plymouth-based team playing in the top league of the sport in the future and we wish the nine teams involved with Super League Basketball the best of luck in the coming season."</p>

        A star-studded United States side showed their quality when it mattered as they fought back from a 13-point deficit in the final quarter to beat Serbia in a thrilling Olympic men's basketball semi-final.

The vast array of NBA superstars, led by LeBron James and Steph Curry, trailed 76-63 after three quarters.

But they turned up the heat and turned around the deficit to win 95-91 at a noisy Bercy Arena.

"To come back the way we did... I've seen a lot of team USA basketball and that was a special," said Curry, who finished with game-high 36 points.

The comeback maintained the Americans' bid for a fifth successive gold in an Olympic event which they have dominated since it was introduced in 1936.

On Saturday, they will play hosts France in the gold-medal match.

Serbia, led by Nikola Jokic, the NBA's reigning most valuable player (MVP), must settle for a crack at bronze when they face Germany earlier on the same day.

The Gen Z Dream Team prove their worth
Pretty much every US Olympic squad since the 1992 Games has been compared to the 'Dream Team' led by Michael Jordan and none have ever come close.

This Gen Z ensemble cast, featuring four NBA regular season MVP winners - James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid - 11 NBA All-Stars and seven NBA champions, is not far behind.

Coach Steve Kerr - himself one of the greatest bosses in NBA history - wondered how he would knit together five players from a 12-man squad where each could be a future Hall of Famer.

Against Serbia it took a while for the individuals to get going as a team with only Curry, finding space to land his trademark three-pointers, keeping them within touching distance.

Jokic looked on course to upstage his American opponents, playing a key role as Serbia, who led by as many as 17 points, stifled them in a dominant first half.

But, as the US powered back into the game, Serbia faltered.

Three-pointers from Durant and Embiid started to turn the tide in the last quarter before James bustled through to put them level at 84-84.

Curry landed another from behind the arc as the Americans led with two minutes and 24 seconds left - the first time they had been ahead since 45 seconds after the game started.

With an A-List crowd including rapper Travis Scott cheering them on, they closed out a memorable victory and danced in celebration on the court.

Serbia were unhappy with some of the refereeing decisions in the clutch moments, making their feelings known by lambasting the officials as they walked off the floor.

            <p>PTop seed Iga Swiatek breezed into the third round of the US Open with an emphatic win over Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara.

The five-time major winner dropped just one game against Shibahara, who managed to hold serve early in the second set to avoid a dreaded 'double bagel'.

Swiatek, 23, didn't face a single break point as she wrapped up the 6-0 6-1 victory in 65 minutes.

Former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina withdrew from her second-round match against France's Jessika Ponchet because of "injuries", handing the world number 143 a walkover.

"I did not want to finish the last Grand Slam of the year this way but I have to listen to my body, and I hope I can close out the remainder of the year strong," Rybakina, the fourth seed, said in a statement.

Earlier, Italy's fifth seed Jasmine Paolini progressed after Karolina Pliskova retired just three points into their second-round encounter.

The 2016 runner-up was 30-15 down in the first game when she pulled up injured.

Czech Pliskova requested medical treatment for her foot, but was unable to continue and limped off Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Paolini, a finalist at this year's French Open and Wimbledon, will face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva next.
<br>
Swiatek learns lesson from first-round struggle
Swiatek was made to work hard to beat lucky loser Kamilla Rakhimova in the first round on Tuesday, committing a remarkable 41 unforced errors before clinching a 6-4 7-6 (8-6) win.

But the world number one was clinical against Shibahara, reducing her unforced error count to six and winning 83% of points on her first serve.

"I was a bit tense in my last match, so today I just wanted to focus on the right things and focus on myself," Swiatek said.

"I just wanted to focus on technicalities and what I practiced yesterday on and trying to convert it to my match. Sometimes when the match goes pretty quick, your mind can drift off and you feel too safe."

Swiatek, who won the 2022 title in New York, will face Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after her 5-7 6-1 6-2 comeback victory over Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy.

Elsewhere on Thursday, Russian 21st seed Mirra Andreeva suffered a surprise 6-1 6-4 defeat by American Ashlyn Kreuger, who is ranked 59th in the world.

Sixth seed Jessica Pegula claimed a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory against fellow American Sofia Kenin, who knocked out 2021 champion Emma Raducanu in the first round.</p>
