            <p>PTop seed Iga Swiatek breezed into the third round of the US Open with an emphatic win over Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara.

The five-time major winner dropped just one game against Shibahara, who managed to hold serve early in the second set to avoid a dreaded 'double bagel'.

Swiatek, 23, didn't face a single break point as she wrapped up the 6-0 6-1 victory in 65 minutes.

Former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina withdrew from her second-round match against France's Jessika Ponchet because of "injuries", handing the world number 143 a walkover.

"I did not want to finish the last Grand Slam of the year this way but I have to listen to my body, and I hope I can close out the remainder of the year strong," Rybakina, the fourth seed, said in a statement.

Earlier, Italy's fifth seed Jasmine Paolini progressed after Karolina Pliskova retired just three points into their second-round encounter.

The 2016 runner-up was 30-15 down in the first game when she pulled up injured.

Czech Pliskova requested medical treatment for her foot, but was unable to continue and limped off Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Paolini, a finalist at this year's French Open and Wimbledon, will face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva next.

Swiatek learns lesson from first-round struggle
Swiatek was made to work hard to beat lucky loser Kamilla Rakhimova in the first round on Tuesday, committing a remarkable 41 unforced errors before clinching a 6-4 7-6 (8-6) win.

But the world number one was clinical against Shibahara, reducing her unforced error count to six and winning 83% of points on her first serve.

"I was a bit tense in my last match, so today I just wanted to focus on the right things and focus on myself," Swiatek said.

"I just wanted to focus on technicalities and what I practiced yesterday on and trying to convert it to my match. Sometimes when the match goes pretty quick, your mind can drift off and you feel too safe."

Swiatek, who won the 2022 title in New York, will face Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after her 5-7 6-1 6-2 comeback victory over Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy.

Elsewhere on Thursday, Russian 21st seed Mirra Andreeva suffered a surprise 6-1 6-4 defeat by American Ashlyn Kreuger, who is ranked 59th in the world.

Sixth seed Jessica Pegula claimed a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory against fellow American Sofia Kenin, who knocked out 2021 champion Emma Raducanu in the first round.</p>
